    <p>
      Welcome to the game show more popular than <i>Jeopardy!</i>, <i> What Did Gauss Do This Time? </i> Today on <i> What Did Gauss Do This Time? </i>, you'll be exploring the joys of the least squares method and linear regression through an exercise. Below, you can play with creating a data set and finding the regression line for that data set. Because this is a math-y (and physics-y, and astronomy-y, etc.) show, here are some links to learn more about the math behind this simulation: <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf"> This source from MIT that requires linear algebra to understand, </a> and <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html"> this basic, short and sweet source from Maths is Fun. </a>
